# Audio-Sleep-Inhibitor

A script from **u/ipsirc** that automatically blocks sleep when an audio is playing at the background. It works by scanning the device if there's an audio from a minimized music player, website or video player and blocks the sleep function till the audio stops. It works on any PC that runs on Linux but as of now, it is only tested on 1 Linux distro as that is the distro that my laptops currently use. 

## Tested Linux Distros and Versions:
- Fedora KDE
